## Introduction

In this lesson, we will learn about Cookies, how to use them, tools that you can use to manipulate them, and how to use them to bypass authentication.

## Challenge

> Name:\
> *Admin has the power.*

---

> Description:\
> *Administrators only has the power to see the flag , can you be one?*

## Solution

In this challenge, we are given a website that has a login page, and we need to login as an admin to see the flag.
the login page is very simple we just need to enter a username and a password, and we will get a message that tells us if we are logged in or not.

if we try to login with a random username and password, we will get a message that tells us `Login information incorrect`. so we need to find a valid username and password.

if we look at the source code of the login page, we will find a forgotten comment that says

```html
<!-- TODO: remove this line ,  for maintenance purpose use this info (user:support password:x34245323)-->
```

so we can use the username `support` and the password `x34245323` to login as an support user.

if we login as a support user, we will get a simple web page that tells us

```html
<h1>Hi support</h1>
<h3>Your privilege is support , may be you need better privilages !! </h3>
```

so we need to find a way to get a better privilege.

if we look at the cookies of the website, we will find a cookie called `role` that has a value of `support`.

so we can try to change the value of the `role` cookie to `admin` and see what happens.

if we change the value of the `role` cookie to `admin` and refresh the page, we will get a message that tells us

```html
<h1>Hi admin</h1>
<h3>Admin Secret flag : hiadminyouhavethepower</h3>
```

## Flag

> hiadminyouhavethepower
