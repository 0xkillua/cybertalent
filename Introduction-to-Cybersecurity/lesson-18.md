## Introduction

Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video. The word steganography combines the Greek words steganos, meaning "covered or concealed", and graphein, meaning "writing". The purpose of steganography is to avoid detection; the use of steganography can be combined with encryption as an extra step for hiding or protecting data. The study of steganography is called steganalysis.
