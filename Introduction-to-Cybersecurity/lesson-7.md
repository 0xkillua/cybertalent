## Solution

In this challenge, we Need to spin up the given website, we will be presented with a login page, so we will try to login with some random credentials, and we will get nothing.

if we take a look at the source code of the page, we will find the following comment:

```html
<!-- 
    Guest Account:
    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
    Username:Guest
    Password:Guest  
-->
```

so we will try to login with the given credentials, and we redirected to the following page:

```html
Welcome, Guest !

Access Denied. You have no admin priviliges, Please login with an administrator account
```

If we take a look at the cookies, we will find a cookie called `Authentication` that has a value of `bG9naW49R3Vlc3Q%3D`.

if we decode the value of the cookie using base64  [this website](https://www.base64decode.org/), we will get `login=Guest7`.

so we can try to change the value of the cookie to `login=admin`, encode it using base64, and see what happens.

if we change the value of the cookie to `login=admin`, encode it using base64, and refresh the page, we will get the following message:

```html
Welcome, Administrator !

Congratulation. Your Flag iS :
FLag{B@D_4uTh1Nt1C4Ti0n}
```

## Flag

> FLag{B@D_4uTh1Nt1C4Ti0n}
