## Introduction

In this lesson, we will learn about Sensitive Data Exposure, how can we find some unintentionally exposed sensitive data.

## Challenge

> Name:\
> *Maximum Courage*

> Description:\
> *Max prefers to learn by practicing and not just reading all day, so he set up a webserver and hopes it stays secret, can you prove it has a weakness?*

## Solution

In this challenge, we have a website, and we need to find a way to get the flag.

If we take a look at the home page of the website, we will find a link to the `flag.php` file, so let's take a look at it.

```php
You can't view this flag directly.
<!-- PHP source doesn't appear on HTML comments -->
```

So, we can't view the flag directly, we need to find a way to view the full source code of the php file.

We Could try to use directory enumeration any other helpful paths.

aAfter some enumeration, we will find theses paths:

```bash
/flag.php
/.git
```

So, we have a php file, and a `.git` directory, let's take a look at the `.git` directory. we find that it is forbidden, so we need to find a way to bypass it.

There is a collection of git tools, and one of them is `gitdumper`, we can use it to dump the `.git` directory.

```bash
gitdumper http://wlemxwl32epheze6eg23gmgi834k4nzy52xmanzk-web.cybertalentslabs.com/.git/ ./maximumCourage
```

After dumping the `.git` directory, we still got nothing useful at the first look, but if we used another tool called `gitextractor`, like this:

```bash
gitextractor ./maximumCourage ./maximumCourageExtracted
```

we will get an a new directory called `maximumCourageExtracted`, and inside it, we will find a directory called `0-190de370286e98dda6813ac9c05f679ad60d9f9c`, and inside it, we will find a file called `flag.php`, and if we take a look at it, we will find the flag.

```php
You can't view this flag directly.
<!-- PHP source doesn't appear on HTML comments -->
<?php
exit();
die();
$secret_key = 'be607453caada6a05d00c0ea0057f733';
?>%
```

So, here we have the flag.

## Flag

> be607453caada6a05d00c0ea0057f733
